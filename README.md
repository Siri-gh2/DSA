# Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)

This repository contains my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice journey**, focused on building strong problem-solving skills using **C++**.

The goal of this repo is **consistency, clarity, and correctness** — not just solving problems, but understanding patterns, edge cases, and optimal approaches.

---

## 📌 What This Repository Contains

- Solutions to **DSA problems** from platforms like:
  - LeetCode
  - GeeksforGeeks
  - CodeStudio / Coding Ninjas
- Problems from the **450 DSA Cracker Sheet**
- Topic-wise organized implementations
- Clean, readable C++ code with standard logic

---


> Folder names represent **DSA topics**, and each folder contains problem solutions related to that topic.

---


## 🛠 Language & Tools

- **Language:** C++
- **IDE:** VS Code
- **Platforms:** LeetCode, GFG, CodeStudio
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repo

- Track my **DSA learning progress**
- Strengthen **core problem-solving skills**
- Prepare for **technical interviews**
- Maintain a **structured reference** for revision

This is not copied code — every solution is written after understanding the problem and approach.
